  <h3>What's the point?</h3>
  <p>
    What's the point of keeping up with technology? Why bother reinventing codebases when the end user doesn't give a hoot about
    the code, neither do management, product owners, content editors or anyone else other than the monkeys who have to work
    within that environment.

  <h4>Imagine</h4>
  <p class="relativeP">
    Imagine you need to deliver promotional messages to over 3 million users and you have to use
    <img src="/assets/snail.jpg" alt="snail" class="snail">
    <span class="afterSnail">mail</span>? How about putting shelves up using a nail file instead of an electric drill, or
    using a typewriter instead of a word processor to write articles?
  </p>
  <h4>Reinventing</h4>
  <p class="relativeP">
    Take the humble
    <img src="/assets/washing.jpg" alt="washing machine" class="washing">
    <span class="afterWashing">machine</span> for example. Prior to mechanical washing machines we had human ones. The mechanical
    washing machine enabled women to enter the labour market which changed their bargaining positions within the household
    and in wider society, giving women votes and endless changes. It has transformed the way we live.

  <h4>HTML 5</h4>
  <p>
    HTML 5 was first released in 2008 with a major update 2014. Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest
    multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
    computers and devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML
    1 and DOM Level 2 HTML the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.
